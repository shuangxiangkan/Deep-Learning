### Deep learning with python 

These programs are based on a very classic book **Deep learning with python**. Through these programs, I deepen my understanding of deep learning and neural networks.

### Dive into DL Pytorch

**Pytorch** is a very classic framework for learning deep learning. Through pytorch, I can better put my ideas on deep learning into practice.

### Neural Network and Deep Learning-CNN

Here I did not use other frameworks, but manually implemented a neural network program myself, and the experimental results were not bad. It also deepened my understanding of neural network principles.
